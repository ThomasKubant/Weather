# Weather
A simple weather app that allows user to search a location and get current weather information and a 5 day forecast. The app uses the OpenCage Geocoding API to turn a location in a latitude and longitude, and the OpenWeatherMaps API to display the weather for that location. User's search history is stored in the left column and the user can click each item in their search history to bring the information back up.
